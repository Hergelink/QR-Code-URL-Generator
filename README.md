 🕴️ Why did I built it?
 
 - This was the first usefull project that i have built following along a tutorial that has a real world usecase. 
   I changed the style of the page for a more calm black & white theme with Tailwind.
   I am planing on integration this app with a niche website idea that I have tailoring QR-Code generation for car owners
   to display their information by putting a QR-Code on their windscreens.
